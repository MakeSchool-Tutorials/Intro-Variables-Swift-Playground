#Intro-Variables-Swift-Playground


##What you will learn

- How to define a variable
- Change a variable's value
- Types of variables(string, double, int, etc.)
- Let & Var difference
- Variables using artihmetic operations
- Difference between types
- Fixing a clock!

##Common Issues

- As a first-time programmer, one thing you should be aware of is you cannot use the same variable name twice in the same scope, or in this case, in the playground. It will throw you the error, "Invalid redeclaration of variableName."

- Also remember that you can only change variables, not constants.  If you try to change a value that was initialized with let rather than var it will throw an error.

##What you should understand when finished

- Difference between let & var and int & double
- Defining variables with explicit type
- Creating variables equal to an arithmetic operation
